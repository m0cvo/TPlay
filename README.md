# TPlay

Playing with text/strings.  This is a short WinForms app with an input box - yes I've used a name input but it could be any string - and an output box that shows the string in reverse 
once the button is clicked.  

There are two reverse methods available - one is a standard reversal although this only really works with utf16 char set and the other uses Xor to enable both a faster action and also 
to enable it to use the full UTF32 char set.
